# Gilded Rose Tech Test

https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/individual_challenges/gilded_rose.md

A JavaScript refactor of the 'Gilded Rose' kata.

### Rules

- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
- The Quality of an item is never negative
- “Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
- The Quality of an item is never more than 50
- “Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
- “Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality drops to 0 after the concert
